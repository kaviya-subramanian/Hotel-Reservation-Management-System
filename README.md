# Hotel-Reservation-Management-System
Abstraction in the Hotel Reservation System is achieved through class hierarchies and encapsulation. The Room class defines common attributes like room number, availability, and price, while specific room types (Single, Double, Suite) extend it for customization. The Booking class manages reservations internally, handling availability, dates, and billing calculations. Users interact with simple methods, unaware of the underlying complexities. The HotelReservationSystem class abstracts operations like room management and booking. This design improves maintainability, scalability, and flexibility, allowing easy additions or modifications without disrupting the system. The approach enhances code reusability and user experience.
